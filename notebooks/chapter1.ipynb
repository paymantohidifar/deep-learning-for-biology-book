    "### Deciding What Your Model Will Replace\n",
    "\n",
    "This section from the introductory chapter focuses on the strategic framing of biological deep learning projects, arguing that defining the \"real-world\" target of a model is more critical than the initial choice of architecture. Here are key summary points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Avoid the \"Tinker Trap\":** Deep learning in biology is intellectually stimulating, which often leads researchers to spend excessive time on technical minutiae. To remain focused, one must identify the existing process the model is intended to replace or improve.\n",
    "* **Domain-Specific Impact Areas:**\n",
    "    * **Healthcare & Drug Discovery:** Models aim to replace slow or manual tasks such as dermatological diagnosis, culture-based pathogen detection, manual MRI tumor segmentation, and exhaustive wet-lab screening for drug-target interactions.\n",
    "    * **Molecular Biology:** Computational tools like *AlphaFold* provide 3D protein structures that would otherwise require months of expensive X-ray crystallography or Cryo-EM. Other models act as digital alternatives to RNA-seq (gene expression) or manual variant interpretation.\n",
    "    * **Ecology:** AI replaces labor-intensive field work, such as in-person biodiversity surveys (via acoustics) or manual crop scouting (via satellite/drone imagery), and offers non-invasive alternatives to physical animal tagging.\n",
    "* **Quantifying Success:** Researchers should estimate the potential impact in terms of time, cost, or labor.\n",
    "* **Innovation vs. Replacement:** Not all models replace old workflows. Some enable entirely new capabilities, such as generating *de novo* biological sequences or linking disparate data types that were previously incompatible. In these cases, success must be evaluated without established benchmarks."

    "### Determining Your Criteria for Success\n",
    "\n",
    "Define success metrics early to avoid endless, unfocused experimentation and wasted time in deep learning projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Five Types of Success Criteria:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Metrics**\n",
    "   - **Examples:** accuracy, AUC, F1 score\n",
    "   - Goals may include matching human expert performance, achieving experimental correlation, or maintaining low false-positive rates\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interpretability Requirements**\n",
    "   - Focus on explainability and transparency of model decisions\n",
    "   - Important for domain expert trust, calibrated uncertainty estimates, and understandable feature attributions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Size and Inference Efficiency**\n",
    "   - Critical for resource-constrained environments (smartphones, embedded devices)\n",
    "   - Metrics include inference time, memory usage, energy consumption, and performance per FLOP (floating point operation)\n",
    "   - May prioritize efficiency over raw accuracy for real-time applications\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training Efficiency**\n",
    "   - Relevant when compute resources are limited or in educational settings\n",
    "   - May focus on CPU-compatible models rather than GPU-dependent ones\n",
    "   - Prioritizes fast training and minimal hardware requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generalizability**\n",
    "   - Aims for models that work across multiple datasets or tasks\n",
    "   - Relevant for foundational models designed for broad applicability\n",
    "   - Values flexibility and reusability over single-task optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:**\n",
    "Establishing clear success criteria upfront helps determine when a project is complete and ensures efforts remain focused and realistic while balancing multiple objectives."

    "### Invest Heavily in Evaluations\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation strategy should be a top priority from the start, not an afterthought. It guides the entire project and determines whether your work produces meaningful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Strong Evaluation Involves:**\n",
    "- Defining precise measurement methods and metrics\n",
    "- Establishing validation procedures\n",
    "- Selecting appropriate baselines for comparison\n",
    "- Creating a well-designed evaluation strategy before building models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Strong Evaluations:**\n",
    "- Measure progress accurately\n",
    "- Detect bugs in models or pipelines\n",
    "- Estimate task difficulty\n",
    "- Build intuition about the problem\n",
    "- Provide a known point of comparison to assess if the model is learning meaningfully\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommended Time Allocation:**\n",
    "A rough guideline for successful machine learning projects:\n",
    "- **50%** - Designing evaluation strategies and running baselines\n",
    "- **25%** - Curating or processing data\n",
    "- **25%** - Model architecture development\n",
    "\n",
    "Without good evaluations, you operate blindly — unable to determine if your model is improving, understand trade-offs, or verify meaningful learning is occurring.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Designing Baselines\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explains the importance of **baselines** as practical evaluation tools in machine learning — simple methods that establish minimum performance thresholds to compare against more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of Baselines\n",
    "- Measure progress and understand task difficulty\n",
    "- Catch bugs early in model development\n",
    "- Sometimes surprisingly competitive with complex models\n",
    "- Signal when something is wrong if models can't beat them\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification Baselines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random prediction**: Equal probability for all classes (zero information baseline)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weighted random prediction**: Sample proportional to class frequencies in training data (useful for imbalanced datasets)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Majority class**: Always predict most common class (strong baseline for highly imbalanced problems)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Nearest neighbor**: Predict label of most similar training example (effective for low-dimensional or structured data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Baselines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean/median prediction**: Always predict training set average or median\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Single-feature linear regression**: Fit line using strongest individual predictor (tests incremental value of complexity)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **K-nearest neighbor regression**: Average target values of k most similar examples\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domain-Specific Heuristics\n",

    "### Time-Boxing Your Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-boxing is the practice of setting a fixed, non-negotiable timeframe for a project or specific task. In deep learning research—where projects can become open-ended and \"failed\" experiments are common—this strategy ensures that even unsuccessful ideas provide value without draining unlimited resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategies for Effective Time-Boxing\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Establish a Rigid Deadline:** Determine a realistic total duration for the project (e.g., two weeks or three months). The project should pause or stop once this limit is reached, regardless of whether the target metrics were achieved.\n",
    "* **Define Clear Checkpoints:** Break the timeline into intermediate milestones to monitor progress. Key checkpoints might include:\n",
    "    * Completion of data preprocessing.\n",
    "    * Training and evaluation of a baseline model.\n",
    "    * Reaching a specific performance threshold.\n",
    "* **Micro Time-Boxing:** Apply the same principle to specific sub-tasks or experimental ideas. For example, allocate exactly one week to test a new model architecture; if it does not show improvement within that window, abandon it and move on.\n",
    "* **Structured Reflection:** Use the end of the time-box to evaluate outcomes. Focus on what was learned and what technical insights can be applied to future work, transforming a \"failed\" project into a stepping stone.\n",
    "* **Mitigate Scope Creep:** Guard against the urge to justify extensions or \"one more tweak.\" When perfectionism or indecision stalls progress, consult with a mentor or collaborator to regain perspective and maintain focus on the broader goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** Time-boxing is a tool for maintaining focus and avoiding burnout. It forces a decision-making point where you must evaluate the project's viability, ensuring that your energy is always directed toward the most promising research avenues."

    "### Deciding Whether You Really Need Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "While deep learning is a powerful tool in the biological sciences, it is not always the optimal solution. This section emphasizes the importance of evaluating whether a simpler, traditional approach can meet your project's goals more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Considerations for Choosing Your Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Evaluate Simpler Alternatives:** Before committing to a deep learning architecture, consider if linear regression, decision trees, or basic statistical techniques are sufficient.\n",
    "* **Implementation and Setup:** Traditional methods are generally quicker to implement, easier to set up, and require less specialized expertise to maintain.\n",
    "* **Computational Efficiency:** Simpler models are far less resource-intensive. They can often run on standard hardware (CPUs) with minimal training time, whereas deep learning typically requires expensive GPU resources.\n",
    "* **Interpretability and Debugging:** Deep learning models are notoriously \"black boxes\" and difficult to troubleshoot. Simpler methods are often easier to explain to stakeholders, troubleshoot for errors, and validate against biological ground truth.\n",
    "* **Weighted Trade-offs:** The smarter path is often the one that delivers the required performance with the least amount of complexity. If a traditional method provides the necessary insights, the overhead of deep learning may not be justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takaway:** The decision to use deep learning should be based on necessity rather than novelty. Prioritizing simplicity when possible leads to more robust, interpretable, and cost-effective biological research."

    "### Ensuring That You Have Enough Good Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of biological deep learning, where data acquisition can be expensive and prone to technical noise, the mantra of \"garbage in, garbage out\" is particularly relevant. This section highlights that the sophistication of your model cannot compensate for poor underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Critical Data Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sufficient Quantity:** Deep learning models generally require thousands of labeled examples to generalize effectively.\n",
    "    * **Benchmarking:** Consult existing literature to determine the standard dataset size for your specific biological task.\n",
    "    * **Transfer Learning:** If your dataset is small (e.g., a rare disease cohort), use transfer learning. Start with a model pre-trained on a massive, related dataset (like ImageNet for microscopy or UniProt for protein sequences) and fine-tune it on your specific data.\n",
    "* **Sufficient Quality:** The reliability of your model is capped by the cleanliness and consistency of your data.\n",
    "    * **Error Impact:** Inconsistent labeling or high levels of experimental noise can cause models to fail catastrophically.\n",
    "    * **Curation:** High-quality, curated data is often more valuable than a larger volume of \"noisy\" data. Prioritizing rigorous quality control (QC) and thoughtful curation is essential for building trustworthy models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** Success in deep learning is a balance between scale and precision. While you need enough data to capture biological variance, that data must be clean enough for the model to learn meaningful patterns rather than experimental artifacts."

    "* **Engage with Digital Communities:** Use platforms like Reddit, Discord, X, and specialized Slack groups to share ideas and meet potential partners.\n",
    "* **Participate in Structured Challenges:** Join hackathons or competitions on platforms like Kaggle or Zindi to meet people with shared interests and receive immediate feedback.\n",
    "* **Prioritize Interdisciplinary Diversity:** Aim for a \"cross-pollination\" of skills. Biologists should seek out machine learning experts, and vice versa, to ensure the model is both mathematically sound and biologically relevant.\n",
    "* **Consult Domain Experts:** Reach out to authors of relevant papers or attendees at conferences. Genuine interest in a specific biological problem often leads to successful \"cold\" outreach and expert guidance.\n",

    "    * **Version Control:** Git for code management.\n",
    "    * **Shared Environments:** Google Colab for interactive modeling.\n",
    "    * **Task Tracking:** Notion, Trello, or simple shared documents to organize workflows.\n",
    "* **Encourage Specialization:** Allow team members to focus on their strengths, whether that is data engineering, infrastructure, modeling, or biological interpretation.\n",
    "* **Pilot the Partnership:** Start with a small, low-pressure \"sprint\" or exploration to test compatibility before committing to a long-term research project.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Why Use JAX and Flax for Biology?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Familiarity:** JAX uses the `jax.numpy` ($jnp$) API, which is almost identical to standard NumPy, making the transition seamless for those already doing scientific computing in Python.\n",
    "* **Functional Clarity:** JAX follows a \"pure function\" style. This explicit approach reduces hidden states, making the underlying math of biological models easier to understand and debug.\n",
    "* **First-Class Transformations:** JAX offers powerful, composable tools:\n",
    "    * `jit`: Just-In-Time compilation via the XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler for speed.\n",
    "    * `grad`: Automatic differentiation for calculating gradients.\n",
    "    * `vmap`: Automatic vectorization to handle batches of data (like thousands of protein sequences) without manual loops.\n",
    "* **Research Alignment:** JAX is the preferred tool for modern \"AI for Science\" research, including major breakthroughs like AlphaFold.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trade-offs and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Learning Curve:** JAX requires a shift toward functional programming, which may feel different than the object-oriented approach of PyTorch.\n",
    "* **Ecosystem Size:** The JAX community is smaller than PyTorch's, and APIs (like the shift from Flax `linen` to the newer `nnx`) can evolve quickly.\n",
    "* **Framework Interoperability:** The book occasionally uses **PyTorch** (e.g., for Hugging Face model embeddings) because certain tools are more mature in that ecosystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advanced Performance Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "While the book focuses on clarity, it identifies four key areas for scaling real-world biological models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Numerical Precision:** Using formats like $bfloat16$ to speed up matrix multiplications on specialized hardware (Tensor Cores).\n",
    "* **Profiling:** Using tools like `jax.profiler` to identify computational and memory bottlenecks.\n",
    "* **Memory Efficiency:** Using **gradient checkpointing** (`remat`) to train deeper models by trading computation for memory.\n",
    "* **Distributed Training:** Scaling models across multiple GPUs or TPUs for massive datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** Choosing JAX and Flax aligns your work with the \"bleeding edge\" of biological research while providing a transparent, mathematically grounded framework for learning.\n",

    "\n",
    "**How `@jax.jit` works:**\n",
    "1. Traces the function using special tracer objects (not real data)\n",
    "2. Builds a computation graph (static representation of operations)\n",
    "3. Compiles via XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) to optimized machine code\n",
    "4. Caches compiled version for reuse with same input shapes/types\n",
    "5. Results in ~20x speedup on GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "**JIT Debugging Challenges:**\n",
    "- `print()` statements and `pdb` don't work as expected\n",
    "- Side effects are skipped during tracing\n",
    "- Cryptic error messages referencing internal JAX/XLA code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: Set environment variable `JAX_DISABLE_JIT=True` to globally disable JIT for debugging or you may set directly in your Python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import jax\n",
    "jax.config.update(\"jax_disable_jit\", True)\n",

    "#### Bonus: More about JIT compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **\"Just-in-Time\" (JIT)** refers to the exact moment the compilation happens. In traditional programming languages (like C++ or Fortran), compilation happens before you ever run the program. In JAX, the compilation happens *while the program is running*, specifically the very first time a function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a breakdown of why this distinction matters and how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. The Timing: A \"Late\" Compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "In a standard \"Ahead-of-Time\" (AOT) workflow, you compile your code into a binary file, and then you run that file. In JAX, you provide a Python function, and the \"Just-in-Time\" compiler stays idle until you actually trigger that function with real data.\n",
    "* **Step 1:** You define the function.\n",
    "* **Step 2:** You call the function with an input of a specific shape (e.g., a protein sequence of length $L = 500$).\n",
    "* **Step 3 (The \"Just-in-Time\" part):** JAX realizes it doesn't have a compiled version for that specific input shape yet. It pauses, converts the Python code into an optimized XLA kernel, and then executes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Tracing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason JAX waits until the \"last second\" (Just-in-Time) is because it needs to see the **shapes** and **types** of your data to optimize effectively. This process is called **Tracing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call a JIT-ed function, JAX sends \"abstract\" versions of your data through the function to see what happens. It records every operation (+, −, ×, ÷) to create a **StableHLO** (a high-level intermediate representation). By waiting until you provide data, JIT can:\n",
    "* See that your matrix is $1000 \\times 1000$.\n",
    "* Optimize the machine code specifically for those dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Specialization\n",
    "\n",
    "If you call the same function later with a *different* shape (e.g., a sequence of length $L=200$), JAX will compile it again, \"Just-in-Time\" for that new shape. It builds a library of specialized versions of your function in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Summary of Comparison of different compilation methods\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Interpreted (Python/NumPy) | Ahead-of-Time (C++/Fortran) | Just-in-Time (JAX/XLA) |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **When is it compiled?** | Never (translated line-by-line) | Before the program runs | During execution (on first call) |\n",
    "| **Performance** | Slow (High overhead) | Very Fast | Very Fast |\n",
    "| **Flexibility** | High | Low (must re-compile manually) | High (auto-specializes to shapes) |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why this is a \"Scientific\" Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "In biological modeling, we often deal with variable-sized inputs (different DNA lengths, different number of atoms in a molecule). JIT allows us to write flexible Python code that feels \"easy,\" while the compiler works \"Just-in-Time\" to give us the speed of a low-level language like C++."

    "#### 3. Preconfiguring JAX JIT with `partial`\n",
    "\n",
    "`functools.partial` prefills/binds arguments to create new functions with fixed values, a general utility in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import partial\n",
    "\n",
    "def scale(x, scaling_factor):\n",
    "    return x * scaling_factor\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create new function with scaling_factor fixed to 10\n",
    "scale_by_10 = partial(scale, scaling_factor=10)\n",
    "scale_by_10(3)\n",
    "# Output: 30\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `scale_by_10` is a new function that behaves like `scale(x, 10)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**JAX-specific usage with static arguments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of JAX, `partial` is often used to customize a decorator before applying it, like this: `@partial(jax.jit, static_argnums=...)`. This is a way to configure the `jax.jit` decorator itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from functools import partial\n",

    "import jax.numpy as jnp\n",

    "    elif average_method == \"median\":\n",
    "        return jnp.median(x)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported average type: {average_method}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "data_array = jnp.array([1.0, 2.0, 100.0])\n",
    "\n",
    "# JAX compiles one version for average_method=\"mean\"\n",
    "print(f\"Mean: {summarize('mean', data_array)}\")\n",

    "# JAX compiles another version for average_method=\"median\"\n",

    "# Median: 2.0\n",
    "# Mean again: 34.333335876464844\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we didn’t mark `average` as static with `static_argnums=(0,)`, JAX would throw an error, because it can’t trace control flow that depends on strings unless it knows their value ahead of time. Marking arguments as static tells JAX to compile a separate, specialized version of the function for each unique value of that static argument it encounters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Static vs Dynamic arguments:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dynamic**: Numerical inputs (`jax.Array`, `float`, `int`) - can vary without recompilation if shapes/types remain constant.\n",
    "* **Static**: Strings, Python objects, functions - affect control flow; must mark with `static_argnums` or `static_argnames` or use closures (see next section)."

    "#### 4. Closures\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, a **closure** is a function object that \"remembers\" values in the enclosing scope even if they are no longer present in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a closure to exist, three conditions must be met:\n",
    "1. There must be a **nested function** (a function inside a function).\n",
    "2. The nested function must refer to a value defined in the **enclosing function**.\n",
    "3. The enclosing function must return the nested function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def outer_function(x):\n",
    "    def inner_function(y):\n",
    "        return x + y  # inner_function \"closes over\" x\n",
    "    return inner_function\n",
    "\n",
    "add_five = outer_function(5)  # x is 5\n",
    "result = add_five(10)  # y is 10\n",
    "print(f\"Closure result: {result}\")\n",
    "# Output: Closure result: 15\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The `nonlocal` Keyword \n",
    "\n",
    "By default, a closure can read the outer variable but cannot modify it. If you want to change a variable in the enclosing scope, you must use the `nonlocal` keyword. This is common for creating \"counters\" or \"accumulators.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def make_counter():\n",
    "    count = 0\n",
    "    def increment():\n",
    "        nonlocal count  # Allows modification of the outer 'count'\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "        return count\n",
    "    \n",
    "    return increment\n",
    "\n",
    "counter_a = make_counter()\n",
    "print(counter_a())  # Output: 1\n",
    "print(counter_a())  # Output: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "counter_b = make_counter()\n",
    "print(counter_b())  # Output: 1 (Starts its own separate count)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why use Closures?\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning (and especially in JAX), closures are powerful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Hiding:** They provide a way to store state without using a full Class object.\n",
    "* **Function Factories:** You can generate specialized versions of a function (like a specific loss function with fixed hyperparameters).\n",
    "* **Decorators:** Closures are the underlying mechanism that makes Python decorators work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison to Classes\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "| Feature | Closure | Class |\n",

    "### Anatomy of a Training Loop with JAX/Flax\n",
    "\n",
    "The core structure of training a model remains fairly consistent in machine learning projects. Here are the list of core steps when you are trainining a model:\n",
    "1. Defining a dataset\n",
    "2. Defining a model\n",
    "3. Creating a training state\n",
    "4. Defining a loss function\n",
    "5. Defining the training step\n",
    "6. Handling auxilary outputs in the loss function\n",
    "7. Defining the training loop\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section, we will go through each step with a working example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Defining a dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a dataset with a linear relationship between the feature $x$ and the label $y$. We will use JAX random generator to add noise to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on randomness in JAX:** In JAX, randomness is handled differently than in standard NumPy or PyTorch. Because JAX is functional and deterministic, it uses *Explicit Pseudo-Random Number Generation (PRNG)*. This means you must manually manage and \"pass\" the state of the random number generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initializing the Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    rng = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Above code creates a \"seed\" or a master key. In JAX, the `rng` (Random Number Generator) state is an array of *two integers*. Unlike `np.random.seed()`, which sets a global hidden state, JAX requires this explicit key to ensure that if you run the same code twice, you get the exact same results (reproducibility).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Splitting the Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    rng, rng_data, rng_noise = jax.random.split(rng, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    The above code \"splits\" the master key into three new, independent sub-keys. This is the most important rule in JAX: *Never reuse a key.* If you used the same `rng` to generate both your data and your noise, they would be correlated. The outputs of `split` in above code are:\n",
    "    * `rng`: A new \"lead\" key to be used for future splits.\n",
    "    * `rng_data`: A key specifically for generating the $x$ values.\n",
    "    * `rng_noise`: A key reserved for generating noise to be added to the label.\n",
    "\n",
    "In NumPy, the state is updated behind the scenes (mutated). In JAX, the state is passed explicitly (functional).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Step | NumPy (Implicit) | JAX (Explicit) |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **Initialization** | `np.random.seed(42)` | `key = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)` |\n",
    "| **State Update** | Automatic | `key, subkey = jax.random.split(key, 2)` |\n",
    "| **Generation** | `np.random.uniform()` | `jax.random.uniform(subkey)` |"

    "#### 2. Defining a model\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explains how to define and initialize a model using *Flax*, highlighting the library's functional design and its unique approach to parameter management.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flax Modules**: Models are created by inheriting from `nn.Module`. Unlike PyTorch, these modules are stateless blueprints; they do not store the weights internally.\n",
    "* **The `@nn.compact` Decorator**: This allows for \"inline\" layer definition. We can declare and use layers (like `nn.Dense`) directly within the `__call__` method, simplifying the code for sequential architectures. In the explicit style (Without `nn.compact` decorator), we define our sub-layers in `setup()` and then simply call them in `__call__()`. When the model is initialized in the dry-run, `setup()` is called first then `__call__()` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    class LinearModel(nn.Module):\n",
    "        def setup(self):\n",
    "            \"\"\"Initializes the layers of the model explicitly.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            This method is called internally by Flax when the model is \n",
    "            initialized or applied for the first time.\n",
    "            \"\"\"\n",
    "            # We define the layer as a class attribute here.\n",
    "            # Note: We still don't define the input shape; \n",
    "            # Flax handles that during model.init()\n",
    "            self.dense = nn.Dense(features=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "        def __call__(self, x):\n",
    "            \"\"\"Defines the forward pass using pre-defined layers.\n",
    "            \n",
    "            Args:\n",
    "                x: Input data array.\n",
    "                \n",
    "            Returns:\n",
    "                The output of the dense layer.\n",
    "            \"\"\"\n",
    "            # We simply reference the attribute defined in setup.\n",
    "            return self.dense(x)\n",
    "        \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "### Bonus: Difference between `linen.nn` and `nnx` by an example\n",
    "\n",
    "In the JAX ecosystem, **Linen** (the traditional Flax API) and **NNX** (the newer, experimental Flax API) represent two fundamentally different philosophies for building neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difference lies in how they handle *State* (the weights, biases, and batch stats).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Core Philosophical Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Linen: Purely Functional:** Linen follows JAX’s functional purity strictly. A `Linen` module is just a set of instructions; it *does not store data*.\n",
    "    * **The Model:** A stateless blueprint.\n",
    "    * **The State:** A separate, immutable dictionary (`params`).\n",
    "    * **The Workflow:** You must pass the variables into the model every time you call it: `model.apply(variables, x)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NNX: Object-Oriented JAX:** NNX introduces a \"Reference-based\" approach that feels much more like PyTorch or standard Python classes, while still being compatible with JAX transformations.\n",
    "    * **The Model:** An object that actually holds its own state.\n",
    "    * **The State:** Attributes of the class (e.g., `self.kernel`).\n",
    "    * **The Workflow:** You call the model directly: `model(x)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Side-by-Side Code Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flax Linen (Functional):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import flax.linen as nn\n",
    "\n",
    "    class LinearLinen(nn.Module):\n",
    "        @nn.compact\n",
    "        def __call__(self, x):\n",

    "    out = model.apply(variables, x) # Must pass variables back in\n",

    "    class LinearNNX(nnx.Module):\n",

    "    out = model(x)                             # Call like a normal function\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Key Differences Table\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Flax Linen | Flax NNX |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| **State Management** | **Stateless**: Params are in a separate dict. | **Stateful**: Params are attributes of the object. |\n",
    "| **Transformations** | Use `jax.jit(model.apply)`. | Use `nnx.jit(model)`. |\n",
    "| **Shape Inference** | Excellent (via `@nn.compact`). | More explicit (usually defined in `__init__`). |\n",
    "| **Initialization** | Requires a \"dummy\" forward pass. | Standard Python initialization. |\n",
    "| **Complexity** | Higher \"boilerplate\" for state management. | Lower boilerplate; feels like PyTorch. |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why NNX is developed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Linen is mathematically beautiful but can be mentally taxing for complex architectures (like GANs or models with many moving parts) because you are constantly piping dictionaries through functions. NNX was designed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Make it easier for developers coming from PyTorch/Keras.\n",
    "* Allow objects to track their own state (like optimizer state or RNG counters) internally.\n",
    "* It uses a clever \"functionalization\" process under the hood so that it still plays perfectly with `jax.grad` and `jax.jit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which one should we use?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Use Linen:** If you prefer the absolute clarity of \"data in, data out\" functional programming.\n",
    "* **Use NNX:** If you find the dictionary-passing in Linen tedious and want a more modern, object-oriented feel that is likely the future of the Flax ecosystem."
